    "content": "This is the halo effect, and it’s subtly influencing your thoughts without you realizing. It’s a phenomenon where if a person has one positive trait, like being conventionally good looking, then we assume they have other positive trait, like being intelligent, kind or successful, even if we just met them and have no evidence to support that. And this happens in almost every area of life. Teachers might assume a student who excels at one subject like math, is a strong student overall even if they actually struggle in other areas. But the halo effect can also work in reverse, like if a person has one negative trait, like having dirty clothes, it leads us to believe they’ve other negative trait as well, like being lazy, disorganized & unproductive. So, how can we use this to our advantage? For ourselves, we can try & be more aware that the halo effect exists & to try to make good first impression. And with others, we can try to not let one positive/negative trait define our entire perception of them"
