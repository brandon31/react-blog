        <p>
          Hi, I'm <b>Nabil Suleiman</b>. Welcome to my blog page where I post
          about things on my daily life and tips on what I have knowledge on.
          I'm a programmer, and I started programming when I was 15 years and I
          am now 18, close to turning 19. I'm a Software Engineer major, and I
          consider everything I know because I'm self-taught, and I go online, I
          look stuff up & research all of that.
        </p>
        <h3>Why I got into programming?</h3>
        <p>
          So as a kid, I was always one of those kid who can do very well in
          school, but had to put very minimum effort in & I'm sure you know who
          those kids are. This was great, because I didn't have to do homework,
          or study & never worry about doing poorly on a test, but I still never
          fail challenge, and this led to me being bored in class and not having
          much to do. So as a kid, I was always curious how things work and why
          they work. So one day, I went online & search
          <strong>"How do computers work"</strong>
          and I watched a few videos, and I was like
          <strong>
            <i> WOW !! This is really interesting! </i>
          </strong>
          And through researching I eventually came to programming. Programming
          was completely something new to me. I never heard of it, my teachers
          never talked about it. It was just completely new to me. I started
          learning <strong>HTML & CSS</strong> through watching tutorials
          online. And after doing it for probably a day, I became immediately
          addicted. That was the first time for me, that I felt slightly
          challenged & and it was just an amazing feeling for me, beacuse I was
          actually having to think logically, and just do awesome things on a
          computer.
        </p>
        <h3>How I learned programming?</h3>
        <p>
          So I started learning programming almost every night, watch tutorials
          on my phone, program along, mess with some things & I just absolutely
          loved it. So over the course of the years, I got really good at{" "}
          <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b>, and by the time I reach that JavaScript
          level. I was doing some dynamic stuff with my HTML. I really loved
          JavaScript, and I'm a creative person. I don't like the backend
          aspect, so I was just pretty decent at JavaScript. Now, I went up to
          learn <b>C#</b>, I didn't really dedicate much time to <b>C#</b>,
          because It was just a recommendation from someone, he was like
          <b>
            <i>"Hey, C# is a great language, you should learn that."</i>
          </b>{" "}
          Don't know if I completely agree with him on that one, but I learned
          it, and that was my first real programming langauge. And that was
          where I became emersed on programming concepts & started developing
          <b>Software Engineering</b> skills and getting good at real
          programming. <br />
          In my opinion, <b>HTML & CSS</b> is a good starting point, but it
          doesn't teach you that logical foundation that you need to be a
          well-programmer. So I started learning C#, and I did that again, every
          night. I remember creating a little application that'll solve math
          problems. I understaood <b>Functions, Classes, Methods.</b> But I was
          not really at an advance level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now after getting pretty decent at <b>C#</b>. I joined discord server,
          where you can join a competition, answer some questions & you get
          graded base on your performace. So I asked the person who's running
          it, and I was like{" "}
          <b>
            <i>"Hey, can I write this in C#"</i>
          </b>{" "}
          because that was the one I really know & he was like{" "}
          <b>
            <i>"No"</i>
          </b>{" "}
          They don't support <b>.NET</b> languages, but if want to participate,
          you should learn <b>python</b>. So picking up python, anyone who've
          gone from <b>Java, C#, C++</b> know that python has so many amazing
          features, that'll take you 10 or 20 lines to do in <b>C#</b>, for
          instance, functions that can do it for you. I immediatelyfell in love
          with python and I started learning it & learning it. But by the time
          that competition came, I didn't feel confident enough to do it,
          looking back I probably should've just done it, but I didn't know that
          well. I was still looking up to some syntax. <br /> I continue
          learning python & I roll in an actual programming course. This course
          taught me a lot after I completed it. I started building projects, and
          learning new <b>python libraries</b>. I learned Selenium, Flask,
          Pygame and more libraries. I keep getting better & better. And then
          after I built several projects with Flask. I started leaning towards
          web development, which led to me learning a JavaScript framework
          called <b>React.</b> <br />
          It took me a month learn the basics of <b>React</b>. I started
          building projects with React, which I find more easier than using{" "}
          <b>Vanilla JavaScript</b>. In summary, I'm currently a{" "}
          <b>Frontend Developer</b>, still learning <b>Backend Development</b>{" "}
          to level up my abilities to become a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b>
